On several occasions they organize meetings that can be attended freely. The purpose of these meetings is to get to know the company and their products. Since we bought several of their sensors, it was the perfect time to socialize.

While most of the information given on IoT was not new to us, their IoT platform was. Basically they developed an easily configurable platform that produces a dashboard for sensor values.
